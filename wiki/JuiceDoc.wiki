== StringBuffer ==

_juice.text.StringBuffer_ offers a buffer to build strings. Very useful if you need to concatenate small pieces of text to build a sentence. Some comparison tests showed that the use of string buffer is much more efficient than using str = str1 + str2.

*Constructor:*

var buffer = new juice.text.StringBuffer()

*Methods:*

   * *append(string)*: appends a string to the end of the current buffer. Returns a reference to the buffer, allowing to append in sequence. Example: _buffer.append("Hello").append(" ").append("World")_.

   * *toString()*: join all the strings appended and returns a string. Example: _buffer.toString() returns "Hello World".

   * *concat(char): join all the strings and puts char between strings. Example:_buffer.concat("#") returns "Hello# #World#".
